Welcome to the website for the Bioinformatics Virtual Coordination Network (BVCN). The group was started in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As research laboratories were shutting,  we, a group of bioinformaticians and computational biologists, sought to formalize training to helping wet-lab biologists pick up some computational skills/begin computational projects during the global crisis. 

Please see [here](https://biovcnet.github.io/_pages/get-involved/) if you'd like to be involved by either helping or participating or both!

# BVCN Organization

This webpage functions as the central hub for the Bioinformatics Virtual Coordination Network. To get started with the various lessions and tutorials created by our instructors, you should visit our [Wiki page](https://github.com/biovcnet/biovcnet.github.io/wiki). From there you can access the 10 topics created by the [BVCN Volunteer Instructors](https://biovcnet.github.io/people.html). If you'd like to participate in the BVCN – ask questions, meet other scientists at your experience level, participate in discussion – you can receive an invitation to our Slack channel by completing this [survey](https://forms.gle/bwe3pmAF2YppUT5d7).
